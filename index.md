I am **Hongwei Li**, a Ph.D. student at **UCSB**, working with [Dr. Wenbo Guo](https://cs.ucsb.edu/people/faculty/wenbo-guo). I am a member of [Shellphish](http://shellphish.net/) and a core member of [ARTIPHISHELL](https://shellphish.net/aixcc/index.html). 

My research interests primarily focus on **AI for Security (AI4Sec)**, including:
- Using **reinforcement learning** to assist **collaborative fuzzing**.
- Leveraging **large language models (LLMs)** for **automatic patching**.
